# Machine-Learning

<p>Machine Learning (CS545 Portland State University)</br>
ML Algorithms are implemeted from Scratch and a Project in [this repository](https://github.com/Sree-Vandana/ML-Project) titled <i>Heart Disease Predictor</i> is implementedand different algorithms are analized based on their Performance</p>

This Repository consists of ML Algorithms Implementations from scratch, The Algoritms include
* K Means
* Fuzzy C Means
* Naive Bayes
* Single Perceptron
* Multi-Layer Neural Network
